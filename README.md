# Arduino-and-PelcoD

Arduino programs from a project that involved implementing the PelcoD protocol on an Arduino Uno in such a way that the Arduino could communicate with an M1-D infrared camera via Rs-485

The file ```M1_D_controller.ino``` utilized a series of push buttons on a breadboard to control the camera.

The file keyboard_controller maps certain keys on a PS2 keyboard to certain movements of the camera.
